### Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm build          # Build the action
pnpm test           # Run all tests
pnpm test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage report
pnpm lint           # Lint code with ESLint
pnpm format         # Format code with Prettier
pnpm types          # TypeScript type checking
```

## Testing

This project maintains a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows end-to-end
- **Golden File Tests**: Test output formatting and generation

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test files
pnpm test tests/unit/section.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Mock external dependencies (GitHub API, Last.fm API)
- Aim for high coverage of new code

## Golden File Tests

Golden file tests compare actual output against pre-approved reference files. This is perfect for testing README generation where we care about exact formatting.

### Understanding Golden Files

Golden files are stored in `tests/golden/fixtures/` and contain the expected output for various scenarios:

```
tests/golden/fixtures/
├── sample-input.json              # Test input data
├── sample-lastfm-data.json        # Mock Last.fm API responses
├── expected-artists-section.md    # Expected artists section output
└── expected-recent-section.md     # Expected recent tracks output
```

### Updating Golden Files

When you intentionally change the output format (like modifying how sections are rendered), you need to update the golden files:

```bash
# Regenerate all golden files
UPDATE_GOLDEN=true pnpm test tests/golden
```

**⚠️ Important**: Only use `UPDATE_GOLDEN=true` when you've intentionally changed the output format. Always review the diff to ensure the changes are what you expect.

### When to Update Golden Files

**✅ Update golden files when:**

- You modify section formatting or layout
- You change how data is rendered (e.g., number formatting)
- You add new configuration options that affect output
- You fix formatting bugs

**❌ Don't update golden files when:**

- Tests are failing due to logic errors
- You haven't reviewed what changed
- The output looks wrong or broken

### Golden File Workflow

1. Make your changes to the code
2. Run tests - they will fail showing the diff
3. Review the diff carefully
4. If the changes look correct, run `UPDATE_GOLDEN=true pnpm test tests/golden`
5. Commit both your code changes and the updated golden files

## Making Changes

### Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. **Add types** first in `src/lastfm/types.ts` if needed
2. **Write tests** before implementing (TDD approach recommended)
3. **Update documentation** in README.md if user-facing
4. **Add golden file tests** if the feature affects output formatting
5. **Ensure backwards compatibility** or document breaking changes

### Common Development Tasks

**Adding a new section type:**

1. Add the section type to `SectionComment` in `src/section.ts`
2. Create a new file in `src/sections/` (e.g., `nowplaying.ts`)
3. Add the section updater to `src/index.ts`
4. Add comprehensive tests in `tests/unit/`
5. Add golden file tests for the new section format

**Modifying output formatting:**

1. Update the formatting logic in `src/section.ts`
2. Run tests to see what changed
3. Review the changes carefully
4. Update golden files with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=true pnpm test tests/golden`
5. Update documentation if needed
